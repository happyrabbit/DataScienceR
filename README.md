# Doing Data Science with R

**The package is under developing  and is not ready to use!**

The DataScienceR package contains functions to streamline real-world data science practice. There are three major topics:

- Predictive Analytics (complementary to caret package)
- Market research analysis (psychometric models and segmentation)
- Unstructured data analysis (text mining, web scraping)

The package utilizes a number of R packages. `DataScienceR` loads packages as needed and assumes that they are installed. Install package using:

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("happyrabbit/DataScienceR")
library(DataScienceR)
```
